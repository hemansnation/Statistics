# Statistics

There are 2 sets of tools for statistics:
1. Descriptive Statistics: It is used to identify important elements in a dataset and describe the dataset.
2. Inferential Statistics: It explain those relationships via other elements.

```python
            Statistics
     Descriptive     Inferential
Univariate                Hypothesis Testing 
Bivariate                 Model Fitting
Multivariate

```

Descriptive statistics help us summarize the data. 
- It is the first step in exploratory data analysis.
- It helps us understand the data.
- It help you detect outlier.
- Plan to prepare data.
- It also helps us in feature engineering.

```python
          Descriptive
Univariate  Bivariate  Multivariate


```

Univariate: It involves single variable.

Bivariate: It involves 2 variables, examples: correlation and covariance.

Multivariate: It includes multiple variables, examples: corrilation matrix and covariance matrix.

### Lets understand Univariate Statistics

It is divided into 3 parts:

1. Frequency
2. Central Tendency
3. Dispersion
