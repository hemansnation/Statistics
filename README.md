# Statistics

There are 2 sets of tools for statistics:
1. Descriptive Statistics: It is used to identify important elements in a dataset and describe the dataset.
2. Inferential Statistics: It explain those relationships via other elements.

```python
            Statistics
     Descriptive     Inferential
Univariate                Hypothesis Testing 
Bivariate                 Model Fitting
Multivariate

```

Descriptive statistics help us summarize the data. 
- It is the first step in exploratory data analysis.
- It helps us understand the data.
- It help you detect outlier.
- Plan to prepare data.
- It also helps us in feature engineering.

```python
          Descriptive
Univariate  Bivariate  Multivariate


```

Univariate: It involves single variable.

Bivariate: It involves 2 variables, examples: correlation and covariance.

Multivariate: It includes multiple variables, examples: corrilation matrix and covariance matrix.

### Lets understand Univariate Statistics

It is divided into 3 parts:

1. Measures of Frequency
- How often a particular value occur in data.
- It includes frequency tables and histogram.
- A histogram is a visualization where we plot the values, bucketized if needed on the x-axis and on the y-axis we have count of record.

2. Central Tendency
- Measure of central tendency for a variable try to determine one value that best represents your data.
- Common measures include average or the mean of your data, the median value and the mode.

Other measures of central tendency
- Geomatric mean
- Harmonic mean

They are used with ratios or rates

### Mean

- It is the single best value to represent your data. It not actually be the data point itself.
- It considers every point available in your data.
- It can be computed on discrete data as well as continuous data.

Discrete data can be numeric value that take on values from a predetermine subset such as star ratings.

Continuous data can take on any value in a range.

#### Mean is extremly sensitive to the presence of outlier.


### Median

- It is less influenced by the outlier.
- The median is that value in your data such that 50% of the dataset is either side of it.
- For calculating mean you have to sort the data in ascending or decending order and then use the middle element.
- It the data points are even then average the middle 2.
- The median might be the better measure of central tendency than the mean because it is much more robust to the presence of outliers.
- Like mean, Median does not consider very data point available in the dataset.
- The median can be computed on ordinal data, data that is not numeric but can be sorted like rating like good bad ugly very ugly.


### Mode

- The value that occurs most frequently in the data, if you plot a histogram, the highest bar represents the mode.
- Examples - casting votes in an election
- It is used with catagorical data, variables that take on a fixed set of values from a predetermined range, examples of catagorical data includes, days of a week, month of the year, makes of cars.
- Mode dont need to be unique.
- Mode is not great for continuous data that can take on any value within the range.

- Contiuous data needs to be descretized before you can perform mode computation.

3. Dispersion
